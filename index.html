This is the initial web page for the Roku Control Center (RCC) from DP Technology LLC app!  This app is not developed by Roku, Inc. nor any current or former employees from Roku, Inc. 

Come back later as this page is still being developed.

This app will be available shortly on Android devices, then iOS devices and possibly on Windows devices.  It will be a free app to download and use, supported by ads.

Within the RCC app, you can create Roku Devices and Playable Items.  From there you can perform various tasks as long as your personal device is on the same network as your Roku device (and your Roku device allows control by mobile apps which is the default behavior).

Thanks for stopping by, hopefully you are not seeing this page but rather a better looking one than this.
