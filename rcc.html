                    <h2>Tasks and Functionality within RCC</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Since we are not associated with Roku nor any of the tens of thousands of Roku Channels, functionality is dependent on how the Channel developers created their Channels.  Currently The Roku Channel supports most if not all of the functionality within RCC. There may be channels out there that work well that we just haven't tested, so if you come across one let us know!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="rcc_numberpad.html">Number Pad</a></li>
                        The Number Pad is a nice and quick way to send number commands to your Roku
                        <a href="rcc_devices.html">Device</a>.  If you watch a lot of Live content within a channel, this functionality allows you to quickly jump from one numbered channel to another without having to scroll your way to it.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li><a href="rcc_linklauncher.html">Link Launcher</a></li>
                        Link Launcher allows you to launch content to your Roku Devices from a simple URL.  If you can even save the Playable Item or Launch Task to be run at a different time.  URLs can be a rokucc.com URL or one of the supported channels.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li><a href="rcc_task_commandlist.html">Command List Task</a></li>
                        The Commond List task allows you to send a list of commands to a Roku Device. Use this task to get to your content that tend to be in the same location.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li><a href="rcc_task_launch.html">Play/Launch Task</a></li>
                        The Play/Launch task takes a saved Playable Item and plays it on your Roku Devices.  A Playable Item can be as simple as launching a channel, launching a channel followed by a list of commands, or if you have access to the Content Id you can launch your content directly.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Play Playlist task</li>
                        The Play Playlist task takes a Playlist of your created Playable Items and will play them in the order you added the Playable Items.  Once your Roku Device stops streaming content this task will attempt to launch the next Playble Item, even if the Items are from different Roku Channels.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Sleep task</li>
                        The Sleep task (similar to the Wake task) will turn down the volume for a determined number of times and length.  Once complete the task will send a final list of commands such as PowerOff or Home.  This task is great for those who have a Roku Soundbar connected to a traditional computer monitor.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Wake task</li>
                        The Wake task (similar to the Sleep task) will launch a Playable Item at a determined time and turn up the volume for a determined number of times and length.  This task is great for those who have a Roku Soundbar connected to a traditional computer monitor.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Volume Control task</li>
                        The Volume Control task (similar to the Commercial Counter task) will attempt to adjust the volume during commerical breaks.  You can set the parameters to help RCC determine if the content is in a commercial break.  This task is depenent on Channel Developers and how they display commercials. This task may not work for live content as well.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Commerical Counter task</li>
                        The Commerical Counter task (similar to the Volume Control task) will attempt to count the number of commericals you see during the breaks.  This task is depenent on Channel Developers and how they display commercials. This task may not work for live content as well.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Channel Tracker task</li>
                        The Channel Tracker task will track the time spent within a channel(idle time included).  This is a great task for people that have so many Roku Channels and want to see how much time they spend in each one.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Party Time task</li>
                        The Party Time task allows you to launch the same content on one or many devices.  Once launched each device will be paused.  Once the host device hits play (doesn't have to be through RCC), RCC will attempt to play all "Party Goers".  When the host pauses, RCC will attempt to pause all the "Party Goers" as well.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Keep Within task</li>
                        The Keep Within task will keep a Roku Device in a particular channel.  This is great for parents who want their children to was safe programming and prevent them from leaving the channel.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Status Change task</li>
                        The Status Change task can monitor a Roku Device and give you a notification if the device's status changes.  Similar to the Keep Within task, this is a good way to keep dibs on a device without have to be watching the content yourself.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Account Login task</li>
                        The Account Login task is task you can store your user name and password so you don't have to navigate to every character.  The Password field is a Password-Typed entry so nobody can see while they are in RCC.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Save one of the above tasks to run in the future</li>
                        If you have a task that you run a regular basis, you can save it and run it on demand in the future.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li><a href="rcc_playableitems.html#share">Share a Playable Item with others</a></li>
                        Once you create a
                        <a href="rcc_playableitems.html">Playable Item</a> you can share it with other people.  You can share a
                        <a href="rcc_linklauncher.html#rokucc.com_link">rokucc.com link</a> which will have all the information needed for another RCC user to seamlessly save or launch.  If you populated the Content Id with a URL from the Channel's website you can share that instead, the people you send it to may need to provide more info before they can play the content.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Play random content within a created Playlist</li>
                        Don't know what to watch?  If you built a Playlist you can have RCC pick a random item.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Install a channel that is already on a different Roku account</li>
                        You can install Roku Channels from RCC.  If you created multiple Devices with multiple Roku Accounts, some devices will have Channels that others don't.  With this app you can select a Channel from the populated list(created and updated with each Device Save) and see which Devices don't have it installed and install it!
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Restart OS</li>
                        A Task that nearly every computer user has done, RCC will attempt to navigate through the settings and perform this task.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Navigate to Roku Setting that determines Mobile Control</li>
                        If you scared a person with the ability to control their Roku Device with your device, RCC will attempt to navigate through the settings to the area where you can block mobile control.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Push PIN</li>
                        If you saved your Roku Account PIN in the Password-Typed entry for a Roku <a href="rcc_devices.html#pin">Device</a>.  You can then send the PIN on demand.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Display the many hidden menus</li>
                        There are many hidden menus.  By default RCC shows you two because the others don't work for some reason.  You can run the other one's but you will need to look at the Task's messages and follow the commands with your Roku remote.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li>Assign Roku Commands to Device Key Presses</li>
                        This app can send a list of commands to a Roku
                        <a href="rcc_devices.html">Device</a> based on a Key Press of your device.  This works great for people who have a "ThumbsUp" or similar button.  These users can assign to launch RCC on press and when you are in RCC another press will send a list of commands. See the three settings regarding the Programmable Button

                    <p class="lead">There are a lot of variables in play when apps communicate with other apps on a network, the default settings should work for most people but if not you can adjust them as needed.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task Messaging Level</li>
                        This setting changed the level of detail when you run tasks.  If RCC is stable for you, set this to as low as you want.  If you are experiencing Instability, try running the tasks with a High setting to see if you can see the problem.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Timeout length when communicating with Roku devices</li>
                        Like all Web Requests, communication with Roku Devices can timeout.  If you notice this being a problem with your network, try increasing this value.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Suspend time between commands when sending a list of commands</li>
                        This is the time RCC will pause before sending subsequent commands.  If you have a strong connection to your Roku Devices, you can lower this value so that command list finish faster.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li id="pin" class="fw-bold">Automatically attempt to put Account PIN if playable content isn't streaming at launch</li>
                        If you have a PIN assigned to moderate content watched and provided the PIN when creating the device within RCC, this setting will attempt to send your PIN if your Roku Device isn't streaming when you play a Playable Item with Content Id and Type.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">At Playable Item Launch how long to wait until pushing Account PIN</li>
                        When loading a channel or content within a channel, there is a length of time between a Roku device saying the channel is loaded and the channel being ready to use.  If you have a Roku PIN assigned to your account, RCC won't know if the content isn't playing because it is still loading or if your Roku device is waiting for you to enter a PIN.  This may vary between channels.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">At Playable Item Launch how long to see if content is streaming</li>
                        When going to content directly, RCC will continuously fetch your Roku's device's status to see if it successfully loaded.  This value will determine how long until RCC gives up if it cannot verify if your content is streaming.

                        If you have a PIN assigned to Install channels and provided the PIN when creating the device within RCC, this setting will attempt to send your PIN after attempting to install a channel.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li id="programmablebutton" class="fw-bold">Programmable Button - Assign a list of commands?</li>
                        A feature in RCC is to send a list of commands to a Roku Device based on a key press of your device.  For example some Android devices has a "Thumbs Up" button that can launch an Android app.  You can assign Roku Commands to this button so that when you are within RCC and press that button, RCC will send those commands.  This is great as a commercial skipper(assign the Select command).
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Programmable Button - Device to send Commands to</li>
                        This is another setting of the Programmable Button feature.  This setting you can make sure that your commands from pressing the Programmable Button go to a particular device.  If you have (none) selected, RCC will attempt to send the list of commands to the first On-line device it knows about.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Programmable Button - Commands</li>
                        The final setting of the Programmable Button are the commands themselves. You can either type in the commands or use the Command List Builder to ensure command structure.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Tasks - All - Commerical Break Assumption length</li>
                        For tasks regarding commericals (Volume Control, Commerical Counter, etc) this is a setting that will be used in helping determine what is a commerical break.  If content is greater than this value RCC will not consider it a commercial.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Tasks - All - Commecial Break minimum length</li>
                        For tasks regarding commericals (Volume Control, Commerical Counter, etc) this is another setting that will be used in helping determine what is a commerical break.  If content is less than this value RCC will not consider it a commercial.  An example is Roku Originals content, each episode starts out with one or two pieces of content that act as a production and ratings intro.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Tasks - All - Do a Task Log Partial Save every (n) messages</li>
                        When you run a task RCC will save a log of the task.  While the task is running it will do little updates in case your task crashes.  If you find your tasks crashing a lot set this value to 10 (the min number) and hopefully you can get an idea of the problem area.  If you don't experience task's crashing very often you can have this number as high as you want.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Tasks - Play Playlist - Prevent Pause state?</li>
                        This setting may go away so :-).
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Tasks - Status Change - Should "In the Channel" be different than "Watching" content in the channel?</li>
                        For Status Change, people may want to know when a device is done streaming vs if somebody leaves a channel. This setting will flip between the two.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Tasks - Wake - How many notches should the Roku device be turn down at the start?</li>
                        When you run a Wake task, you probably don't want your content to turn on at full volume.  RCC can not tell your Roku Device to set the volume to 0 so this setting will tell the Wake task how many notches to turn down before it starts to gradually increase the volume.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Tasks - Time that the app executes a Re-occuring action</li>

                        <li class="fw-bold">Auto Refresh Devices in List</li>
                        This setting will determine if RCC automatically refreshes the status of all the Roku Devices in the list.  If you are running a task against a device, the task will do refreshes on the assigned device while it is running.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Auto Refresh Devices in Minutes</li>
                        This setting will tell RCC how often to do a full list refresh.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Capture fetches to Roku Devices</li>
                        This setting may go away so :-).
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">On resuming the app from background or unlocking device, delay refreshes for 5 seconds?</li>
                        If you notice RCC crashing when you unlock your device, this setting may help.  It will prevent RCC from trying to communicate with Roku devices for 5 seconds as your Operating System may need to do some things before RCC can work as expected.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Battery Saver</li>
                        This setting may go away but the intent is to limit the number of fetches during the executing of some tasks.  For example the typical streaming commerical is no less than 15 seconds, so for the Commerical Counter task RCC will only fetch a Roku Device's status every 15 seconds.

                        <li class="fw-bold">Why can RCC not see my Roku Device?</li>
                        If you are on the same private network and your Roku Device allows mobile control, you shouldn't run into issues.  If you still are, open a web browser on your device and enter the following URL [http://{your Roku's IP address}:8060/query/media-player].  If you do not get a web page in return, then something outside of the RCC app is preventing the app from communicating with the Roku Device.  Make sure 
                        <a href="https://support.roku.com/article/115001480188">Control by Mobile Apps</a> is not disabled on your Roku Device.
                        <li class="fw-bold">RCC crashed while a task was running, the RCC Running Tasks notification is still in the tray and I cannot get rid of it. How can I remove it?</li>
                        On some devices you can access an app's notifications settings from the Notification Tray. If you can go there turn Notifications off and then if you want turn them back on.
                        <li class="fw-bold">More Coming soon.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>On most newer devices, there is an additional battery saver layer that blocks network traffic. Tasks running in background may run but won't be able to connect to Roku devices unless your device is plugged into a power source.</li>
                        <li>When connectivity to devices is weak, tasks may run into issues.</li>
                        <li>Running too many concurrent RCC tasks may cause some stability issues.</li>
                        <li>Random, hopefully not too often, bugs (it is a 0.0.0.0 version after all).</li>
