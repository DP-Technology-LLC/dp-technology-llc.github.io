                    <p class="lead">Devices are a list of Roku Devices that you create for RCC to interface with.  RCC needs an IP Address so it knows who to talk to.  When you save RCC will fetch the device's information and installed channels.  This data will be stored within RCC.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="fw-bold">Name</li>
                        A free text entry for you to give your Playable Item a name.  It is not a unique field so if you are the type who would name all your kids or pets the same name, go for it we won't stop you here.
                        <li class="fw-bold">IP Address</li>
                        A free text entry for you to provide the IP Address of the Roku Device.  If you don't know it, tap the DISCOVER button and RCC will display all the Roku Devices that registered with the Router you are connected to.
                        <li id="pin" class="fw-bold">PIN</li>
                        A password-typed free numeric entry to assign a PIN.  This PIN needs to be the PIN that you created for your Roku account.  You do not need to provide the PIN if you did not set one in your Roku Account or do not want to store it within RCC.  If provided, the Push PIN task becomes available and when RCC tries to install a channel or play content that may be of a certain rating, RCC can automatically provide the PIN.  See the two RCC settings regarding PIN

                    <h2>Tasks/Functions</h2>
                    <p class="lead">From the Devices list there are a number of tasks/functions you do.  Tasks and Menus can be hidden or made visible from the Settings view</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="fw-bold">Info</li>
                        The Info view will show you three sets of data for your Device.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Current State</li>
                            Current State fetches the status of the Roku Device at the current moment.  You can tap on the header label to request an update.
                            <li>Device Info</li>
                            Device Info was fetched the last time you saved your Device.  It contains stuff like Model Name, Model Numbe, etc...
                            <li>Installed Channels</li>
                            Installed Channels was fetched the last time you saved your Device.  If you installed a channel after creating your Device in RCC, it will not be here until you Edit and Save your Device.
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        <li id="share" class="fw-bold">Number Pad</li>
                        This function allows you to send number commands to your Device.  Use this if you watch a lot of live content where the channels are numbered.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task-Keep Within</li>
                        Keep Within will fetch the current Roku Channel from your Device and until the task is stopped RCC keep your device within the channel.   If the user exists the channel, RCC will relaunch the channel.  This works great for parents who want their kids to stay within a Kid Friendly Roku Channel.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task-Sleep</li>
                        Sleep will gradually turn the volume down, based on your settings, until finally running any commands you provide afterwards.  This works great for people who have a Roku Soundbar connected to a tradional computer monitor where there is no Sleep function like a TV.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task-Status Change</li>
                        This task allows users to get a notification if the status of a Device changes.  This is great for people who want to know if a device stops streaming or exits a channel without have to be physically present.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task-Channel Tracker</li>
                        This task will track what channels are used for a selected Device.  This is great for people who downloaded too many channels and need some data determining which ones to get rid of.  ***Warning: To capture a large data set this task needs to run for a long time.  So if you have an older device not in use, it would be perfect for a task like this.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task-Volume Control</li>
                        This task will attempt to adjust the volume during commercial breaks.  This task requires your Roku Device to have control of the volume and is highly dependent on the developers of the channel RCC is monitoring.  If they embed the commercial within the streaming content then this task will not be able to tell what is a commerical and what is not.  On Demand content within The Roku Channel or Music Videos on Vevo work very well.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task-Wake</li>
                        Wake will launch a Playable Item at a certain time and based on your settings, gradually turning the volume up until completion.  This works great for people who have a Roku Soundbar connected to a tradional computer monitor where there is no Wake function like a TV.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task-Push PIN</li>
                        This task will not be an option if you do not
                        <a href="#pin">provide a PIN for your device</a>.  This task will send your PIN to the Device.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task-Restart OS</li>
                        This task will attempt to navigate to the Roku Setting where you would reset your Roku Device.  This task runs the Command List RCC task with a pre-set list of commands.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task-Command List</li>
                        This task will allow you to build a list of Roku Commands and RCC Commands to send to your Device.  While configuring this task you can make use of the
                        <a href="rcc_commandlistbuilder">Command List Builder</a> to ensure you create valid commands.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task-Mobile Control</li>
                        This task will attempt to navigate to the Roku Setting where you can turn change the
                        <a href="https://support.roku.com/article/115001480188">Control by Mobile Apps</a> setting.  This task runs the Command List RCC task with a pre-set list of commands.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Task-Commercial Counter</li>
                        This task will attempt to count the number of commercials that have been served to you.  Similar to the Volume Control task this task is highly dependent on the developers of the channel RCC is monitoring.  If they embed the commercial within the streaming content then this task will not be able to tell what is a commerical and what is not.  On Demand content within The Roku Channel or Music Videos on Vevo work very well.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <li class="fw-bold">Secret Screens</li>
                        There are a number of Secret Screens you can access with your Roku remote.  Currently RCC has two that work through the app and others that don't.  The ones that don't use the correct remote commands but the secret screen won't show.  You can see the commands by running one of them and then looking at the Message Log of the completed RCC task.

                        Yes!  While there are some options you can't hide like Edit or Delete, you can hide any RCC task or Hidden Menu option by going to Maint -> Settings -> Visible Tasks / Super Secret Device Menus).<br />                        
                        <br />
                        <li id="menufaq" class="fw-bold">Why are most Super Secret Device Menu options hidden by default?</li>
                        The secret menus that are hidden by default can't be launched from RCC.  Although the commands are correct, the Roku device does not display those menus.  If you run one of these tasks with a Setting Low Messaging, you can see the commands and repeat them with your Roku remote.
